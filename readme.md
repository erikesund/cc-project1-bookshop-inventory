# Bookshop Inventory Project
## How to Run

Download the zip file from github and install in a location of your choice.
Once downloaded, in the terminal, navigate to the main folder. You will need to run the following commands in the terminal:

1. "psql -d bookshop_inventory -f db/bookshop_inventory.sql"
2. "python3 console.py"
3. "flask run"

Once this is done you will be able to either navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser or hold control and click the link in the terminal window.

## The Brief

### Shop Inventory
Build an app to aid a shopkeeper in tracking their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop employees.

### MVP
- The inventory should track individual Products, including a name, description, quantity, buy_price, and sell_price.
- The inventory should track Manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
- The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit Manufacturers and Products separately.
- It may make more sense for a car shop to track manufacturers and models of cars, while a bookstore might sell books by author or publisher, and not by manufacturer. You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate for your project.
- Create an inventory page, listing all the details for the Products in stock in a single view.
- As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should indicate "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
### Inspired By
eBay, Amazon, Magento

### Possible Extensions
- Categorise your items. Books might be categorised by genre (crime, horror, romance...) and cars might be categorised by type (SUV, coup√©, hatchback...). Provide an option to filter the inventory list by these categories.
- Calculate the markup on items in the store, and display it in the inventory
- Filter the inventory list by manufacturer. For example, provide an option to view all books in stock by a certain author.
